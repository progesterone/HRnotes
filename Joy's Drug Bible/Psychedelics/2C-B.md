## ==Overview / Quick Notes==
A psychedelic of the phenethylamine class, part of the 2C-X family, often times compared to a mix of [[LSD]] and [[MDMA]]. First discovered in 1974, by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. The mechanism of 2C-B is not fully researched, but it is known to interact with 5HT2a, the serotonin receptors. Known for medium strength visuals, euphoria, and contains the ability for ego loss. Considered to have less serious headspace than other [[Drug Classes#tryptamine|tryptamine class]] drugs, like [[LSD]] or [[Psilocybin]] mushrooms.

First being sold as "Eros," as a aphrodisiac, manufactured by Drittewelle, a German pharmaceutical company. Later it also became available as "Nexus," a tablet sold in Dutch "smart shops."

## ==Personal Reflections== 
This substance was pretty fun, I got enhanced visuals, I felt quite pleasant, and was in general pretty joyous. I've tried 30mg at once, and splitting 15mg into 2 consumption points, and it wasn't as strong as I've hoped. I did not purity test. I will try this substance again at a referenced heavy dose eventually. I think I'd use this substance to enhance others at a light-common dose to help with any come downs.
