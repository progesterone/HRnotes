## ==Overview / Quick Notes==
N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, DMT, part of the [[Drug Classes#Tryptamines|Tryptamine class,]] is a short acting but very powerful psychedelic with intense visuals and complete hallucinations. Like many other psychedelics, it's serotonin bind mechanism isn't fully understood. DMT is not as well researched compared to other psychedelics. DMT is typically consumed through inhaling vapor resulting in a short experience, or orally with a combination of a enzyme inhibitor for a longer, intense trip. Many experiences report about encountering entities after consuming strong doses of DMT. Smoked DMT experiences tend to describe a clear headed trip compared to oral dosing.

DMT exists [[Introduction to the chemistry and pharmacology of psychedelic drugs#Drug Classes Tryptamines Tryptamines|naturally within human beings and fungi.]] Found in the CNS, lung and adrenal tissue. Also found in mammals, marine animals, trees, certain species of grass and flowers found around in south Americas. [Archeological discovered that it was used in "snuffs" since 2080 BCE.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425125122) Popularity grew within the mid 80's, which was due to Terence McKenna's and Rick Strassman's writings and research.

## ==Reference Dosage & Timeline==

DMT is available orally, as long as it's taken with a MAO-inhibitor (an enzyme inhibitor) such as Harmine. DMT is rapidly metabolized within the body, breaking down the substance before giving any potent effects.

## ==Tolerance Notes==
DMT is not known to have any tolerance, nor does it produce cross tolerance.

## ==Safety & Harm‑Reduction==
- **Test**: Ehrlich Reagent, fent presence is unlikely but not impossible/
- **Set & Setting**: DMT is a strong psychedelic, it's advised to be sitting down, away from fragile objects. 
- **Hydration**:  DMT is not known to cause dehydration, however those who are extremely dehydrated have increased chances of seizures.
- **Dosage**: DMT is dose sensitive, often times a high enough dose can cause a "breakthrough" experience. Lethal dose has not been reported.
- **Medical Contra‑indications**: Smoked DMT dramatically increase effects of MAOI antidepressants. Avoid usage if family history of schizophrenia.
- **Emergency Plan**: Keep a phone nearby, know the nearest medical facility, and have a sitter who knows how to call emergency services.

## ==Tips==
* Your setting is important. The come-up can be fast, and you will feel disoriented. Recommended to be seated.
#### Storage: 
DMT is sensitive to high temperatures, UV light, oxygen, and water. Store in a airtight container, placed in a cool, dark place. Be careful for mold growth. DMT will oxidize and change color, into yellow, which is not an issue for slight yellowing.

Signs that DMT has degraded significantly:
* Dark brown / Black color
* sticky
* Strange smell
