## ==Overview / Quick Notes==
LSD, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, is a classical semisynthetic psychedelic of the [[Drug Classes#Lysergamides|lysergamide class]] (ergoline), [[Drug Classes#tryptamines|tryptamine substructure]]. First synthesized by [[Albert Hofmann]] on November 16th, 1938 and his first intentional consumption on April 19th, 1943, also known as [[Albert Hofmann#Bicycle Dat|Bicycle Day]]. LSD is known to be very potent, measured in µg, micrograms, with medium to strong visuals, mild-medium body effects, and very strong mental effects. LSD is one of the most researched drugs of today, with a long extensive cultural history creating and stemming many sub cultures starting in the 60s. Seen in cartoons to TV shows, from college lectures to movies, LSD is a celebrity compared to many substances. Today it's a common street drug with a wide range of enthusiast and users, from spiritual use, deeper insight and intellectual use, from raves to festivals alike.

## ==Reference Dosage & Timeline==
Typical routes of administration / ways of consumption include, blotter tabs, gel tabs, liquid drops, and rarely powder.
*  Blotter Tabs are small pieces of soaked in LSD solution. Typically placed on or under tongue
* Gel tabs, small pieces of gelatin containing LSD
* Liquid drops, often sold in vials, highly potent.
* Powder, incredibly potent and hard to dose as LSD is dosed in micrograms.

Total trip lengths are often dictated by how much you take and tolerance. Aka, more you take and lower your tolerance, longer the trip.

## ==Combo Notes==
![[TripSit_combo_chart.png]]
[[TripSit_combo_chart.png]]
TripSit's combo chart. 2/17/26
#### **DANGEROUS** - Avoid combination
* **[[Tramadol]]** - Tramadol lowers seizure thresholds.
* **[[Lithium]]** - Lowers seizure thresholds, and/or significant chance of psychosis.
#### **Caution** - Increases in unpredictable and psychological intensity
* **[[Cannabis]]** - wildly strong synergy with most psychedelics, especially LSD. Increased chances of anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks, and psychosis.
* **[[Amphetamine]]** - Increases anxiety levels, risk of paranoia, thought loops, and psychosis.
* **[[Cocaine]]** - Increases anxiety levels, risk of paranoia, thought loops, and psychosis.
* **[[SSRIS]]** - some SSRIS and LSD are consumed by the CYP2D6 enzyme within the liver, which will heighten the risk of [[serotonin syndrome]]
* **Opioids** - Respiratory depression if sedated

## ==Tolerance and Dependance Notes==
Tolerance on LSD builds up quickly, almost immediately after ingestion, however often tolerance wears off after ~5 days of abstinence.

LSD is known to have cross tolerance with most psychedelics.

LSD is considered non-addictive with low abuse potential, and with no withdrawal symptoms.

---
## ==Safety & Harm‑Reduction==
- **Test**: Reagent testing is needed to rule out NBOMe's. Should NOT taste like anything other than paper or gelatin.
- **Set & Setting**: People often go out for walks or sack themselves to a couch.
- **Hydration**: Does not directly dehydrates you.
- **Dosage**: Fatal toxicity from LSD alone is extremely rare. Reported massive overdoses (multi-milligram range) have survived, though with severe temporary symptoms.
- **Medical Contra‑indications**: Major risks are Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder, and Bipolar I. Often LSD intensifies panic attacks, and potentiate anxiety for people with anxiety disorders. LSD can mildly increase heart rate and blood pressure.
- **Emergency Plan**: Keep a phone nearby, know the nearest medical facility, and have a sitter who knows how to call emergency services.

## ==Tips==
* I recommend putting on a movie or a nature documentary.
* When using with cannabis, you will experience short term memory loss, and possible auditory hallucinations. It'll be hard to keep yourself in a single spot, but prepare yourself with a glass of water before the trip, I woke up out of the trip with 4-5 glasses of water on my nightstand.
* Light meals before dosing may reduce nausea. Heavy meals can delay onset.
* I've experienced increased sensitivity to temperature, so a light blanket and just a baggie hoodie as a top is comfortable. Truly personal preference.
#### Storage: 
LSD is very sensitive to air, light, warm temperature, and moisture. For a long term storage, wrap in tinfoil, place in a plastic baggy, and in a air tight container, and place in a dry spot away from electronics. Some users have just stored their tabs in books, noting that they kept their potency for months to years.

## ==Personal Reflections==
One of my favorite substances, with trippy visuals and a generally comfortable stimulation. My first experience wasn't particularly glamorous, I bought some, took a tab, played counter-strike, and chilled out to music as I peaked mid game. As I continued to peak I started to watch YouTube, where I found seeing people speaking to be disturbing, everyone felt disconnected and disjointed entirely, so I continued to lay back in my bed chatting with a friend who was tripping with me for the first time too. Truly a bonding experience...

Today, when I take LSD I use it as a floor of sorts, to stack other substances and combos onto it, such as [[Ketamine]] and [[2C-B]].
