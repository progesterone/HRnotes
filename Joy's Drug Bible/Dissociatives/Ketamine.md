⚠️**Reminder:** Do not use this as a sole resource. I am human, I'm in my early 20s, and I barely passed high school. The information here is to my best ability accurate and non-biased. Reluctancy of using other sources puts you and others in danger. **Overdoses may not give victims a second chance.** I am not affiliated, approved, nor endorsed with any groups or organizations, the usage of their information and resources is to my dismay.
## ==Overview / Quick Notes==
Ketamine, or 2-CL-2'-oxo-PCM, is a dissociative of the [[Drug Classes#Arylcyclohexylamines|arylcyclohexylamines]] class. Though not fully known, it's seen to block the NMDA glutamate receptor. First developed in 1963 by Parke-Davis laboratories, with first recreational use reports in 1967, was created with the intention of replacing [[PCP]]'s surgical anesthetic uses. Now widely used in human and animal medicine. Recent research shows treatment for typical treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation.  

Typically found in either powder, crystal or liquid form, often times producing similar effects to some psychedelics, such as mild inebriation, dreamy thinking, delayed or reduced sensations. Ketamine is known to cause extreme difficulty in movement, enhanced music appreciation, and has the ability for a near death experience or entering other realities. Ketamine is also associated with what's called a "K-hole", a complete dissociative state of the user, feeling completely detached from one's body.

## ==Reference Dosage & Timeline==

If your goal is to K-Hole, you may need to experiment with doses as the dose for each person is different, usually based on weight. Common ways to approach a K-hole is through small bumps, redosing small lines, till you reach your desired effect. Redosing intramuscular can be difficult under the effects of Ketamine, so it's ill-advised.

## ==Tolerance Notes==
Tolerance is not built rapidly, often only building when approaching high doses and levels at frequent rates. The certainty of frequency, and how long it takes for tolerance to fade is uncertain.

## ==Safety & Harm‑Reduction==
- **Test**: 
- **Set & Setting**: 
- **Hydration**:  
- **Dosage**: 
- **Medical Contra‑indications**: 
- **Emergency Plan**: Keep a phone nearby, know the nearest medical facility, and have a sitter who knows how to call emergency services.
