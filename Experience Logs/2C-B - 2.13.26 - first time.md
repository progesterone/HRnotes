![[2CB Mario Pill.jpg]]
I have acquired some [[2C-B]], in the form of a 30mg pressed pill (in the shape of mario, take that Nintendo.) I will be taking half a pill, as this is my first time.  The last substance I've had was ketamine, a full 24 hours ago, around 200mg in 50mg lines over the course of 3 hours. 

I'm very excited to try this, as my shift I came from (about 2 hours ago) was very tiring. My goals are to listen to take note of body sensations and how music feels/changes.

10:46 PM
Consumed. Cut in half, swallowed the smaller of the 2 pieces, drank with green tea.

11:09 PM
I have yet to notice any effects, I'm hoping that I took enough. If not, I will take a full pill tomorrow.

11:22 PM
I'm beginning to note that colors and lights are becoming "enhanced" or vibrant. My motions feel a little heavy, feeling like I'm swaying. However, most of these are pretty mild.

11:27 PM
I am noticing my jaw clenching, my head getting a weird buzz, itchy scalp, so must be my blood pressure getting tickled.

11:31 PM
I will be taking a shower, no new updates.

12:05am
as I walked down the stairs I really noticed how off balance I am, Im feeling a little light headed, and my scars on my arm are bright red, which either means I'm seeing color shifts (probably) or my blood pressure is being messed with even more (also probable.) I have a light flush, my face is a little warm. I'm getting "increased visual clarity." So far, enjoyable, not strong. I can see why people take 2c-b in conjunction with ketamine. I may do that combo sometime. According to my substance journal app, I'm 80% to the peak. Jaw clenching, and my gums feel/taste weird, similar to LSD.

12:24am
I'm feeling euphoric, there's a stronger flush happening, and the jaw clenching is getting a little obnoxious, but so far so good. I've been listening to music, and there is a increased music appreciation.

Been messing around with obsidian for a little now, installing plugins and themes. I've been thinking about paying to make this obsidian journal a website, easiest way to publish this. I will when I get a substantial amount of substances here, AND write several substantial papers/notes.

12:47am
nothing has progressed, other than unmentioned breathing walls, little tracers, and just general visual enhancements. I feel as if I've plateaued. 

12:58am
I have redosed. Though it's my first time experiencing this substance, and redosing is contradictory of my original intentions, I am however doing this for a experience log sake, for ✨science✨. I know that this will "tarnish" a experience if I just popped the whole pill at once. Oh well.

I am now going to go have toast with cheese whizz and jalapenos :)

1:40am
I am noticing that it is hard to aim in video games, the walls are a little animated, almost fuzzy. Music is pretty good. Jaw clenching is horrible right now, going to chew gum.

2:12am
getting my scalp tingled right now. I am giggling and smiling a lot, I see patterns within a blank gray box in this obsidian note. Every edge of windows on my screen, or objects in my peripheral vision are clean cut. The reflects in my glasses as I look around are kinda trippy. So far, no nausea, definitely should change into something more comfortable though.

2:32 am
I think this is where I will lay in my bed and put on some music, going to put on something nostalgic. This has been quite an enjoyable peak. 

Baseline
Cutting the pill in half and taking it at two different points ruined the potential it could've had. However, it was still a pleasant experience, and there was no "comedown" compared to MDMA.
