# Intro
- "psychedelic"
	- coined by [[Humphry Osmond]] in 1957
	- Implied meaning: unlocks inaccessible parts of mind
Entheogens - subclass of psychedelic drugs
	 used for traditional cultural and religious practices
	 Psychedelics lead to neuroplasticity and increase neuronal connectivity with the brain
	increase interest for clinical study
		difficult to treat mental health conditions
			PTSD
			depression
			addiction
			anorexia
			anxieties
		1970's war on drugs hindered research

Tryptamine substructure:
	[[psilocybin]], [[DMT]], [[LSD]] (ergoline alkaloids in ergot)
Phenethylamines:
	[[Mescaline]], [[MDMA]]
Arylcylohexylamines: dissociative hallucinogens
	[[ketamine]], [[PCP]]
"naturally derived hallucinogens"
	Muscimol, Salvinorin, Ibogaine, Cannabis (delta 9)
Deliriants:
	Tropane alkaloids scopolamine, atropine and hyoscyamine

# History of Human Use of Psychedelics
Muscimol consumption origin Finno-Ugric people, northern Europe and Asia, prehistoric
shamanism associated
interact with spirit world through altered states of consciousness
Practices spread from northern EU to Siberia, into north America from migration
Mushrooms used religiously 8000 years ago, [[psilocybin]] in ancient Egyptians
Psychedelic cactus used over 6000 years ago
Lysergic Acid derivatives present in seeds of "Convolvulaceae family"
	from ipomoea, rivea, and turbina genera. Present day Mexico
## [[Drug Classes#Lysergamides or Ergoamides|Ergolines]]
ergoline alkaloids, major class psychedelics
	EX: [[LSD]]
natural product of parasitic on grasses and grains
Claviceps suggest 67 different ergot alkaloids, not yet ID'd
purpurea and DNA sequencing, fungal species genes responsible for biosynthesis
[[Albert Hofmann]] discovered [[LSD]]
	begun research
		isolated [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]] from traditional fungi teonanacatl
		tried isolating ska maria pastora, Mexican plant
			got instead [[Salvia]] Divinorum
Research showed a common lysergic acid amide substructure
	had variety of biological effects
Tetracyclic Ergoline
	Pergolide, cabergoline and lisuride.
		Not psychedelic, few reports of hallucinations, but used to treat Parkinson's
[[LSD]] affects many receptors, usually serotonin, dopamine, histamine
	Interacts with a lot of 5-HT family receptors
5-HT2a is involved with neocortex, higher order brain function
	cognition and perception
	G-protein (GPCR), type of transmembrane protein
		signal traverse cell membranes through conversion of binding events into intracellular response (wtf does this mean? idfk)
			ultimately responsible for transmission between binding signals to cells (communication)
Agonists - molecules on binding cause receptor activation
Full Agonists - same level receptor activation by high concertation
Partial Agonists - partial GPCR activation
Antagonists - block agonists by binding to remote parts, stopping GPCR manipulation
Inverse Agonists - stabilize inactive receptors, reducing baseline activity

[[LSD]] is a partial agonist of 5-HT2a


## [[Drug Classes#Tryptamines|Tryptamines]]
pendant aminoethyl group extending from indole core
found in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, and amino acid tryptophan
typical tryptamine is [[DMT]]
	found in biological fluids such as the CNS - central nervous system
		IMNT - amino acid decarboxylase and indole-n-methyltransferase
			found in human lung, adrenal tissue and CNS
Tryptamines are also in fungi
	[[psilocin]], [[psilocybin]]
		4-phosphate substitution for the core tryptamine structure
Tryptamines affinity for CNS receptors
	serotoninergic nervous system
		agonism of 5-ht2a receptor
	[[DMT]] is a potent partial agonists of 5-HT2a
		lower affinity for adrenergic receptors
		low affinity for dopamine receptors

## [[Drug Classes#Phenethylamines|Phenethylamines]]
primary or secondary amine linked by two carbon unit to substitute phenyl group. Dopamine and noradrenaline transmitters share this structure
amphetamine stims are part of this class
[[MDMA]] is the best known psychoactive phenethylamine
	first synthesized by Merck in 1912
[[Mescaline]] is most significant rich history of human use
	classical hallucinogens
		pseudohalluincogen - hallucinogens recognized as being subjective and unreal
[[Mescaline]]
	3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine, discovered scientifically 1919
	serotonergic psychedelic, agonism of 5-HT2a
	low-micromolar antagonist of adrenergic receptor
	inhibits norepinephrine (NET), dopamine (DAT), and serotonin (SERT), transporters
	Used to synthesize many phenethylamines by [[Alexander Shulgin]]
Phenethylamines have little room for modification, drastic degradation of potency
SAR studies discovered [[NBOMe]]s
	produce visual and auditory pseudohallucinations akin to [[LSD]]
	hyperthermia, tachycardia, agitation, and seizures
	highly toxic

[[Alexander Shulgin]] forced [[Leo Zeff]] out of 15 year retirement by showing him DMA
	[[Leo Zeff]] studied [[MDMA]], psychotherapy
		so successful that the stepped in and banned it
[[David Nichols]] argues [[MDMA]] is not a psychedelic
	stereochemical consideration - related to [[amphetamines]]
	[[MDMA]]A has a extended alpha substituent to a ethyl group, complete loss of psychoactivity
	similar potency of amphetamine
Nichols rejects the classification of empathogen
Arylcyclohexylamines.
## [[Drug Classes#Arylcyclohexylamines|Arylcyclohexylamines]]
[[ketamine]], [[PCP]], examples synthetic dissociative, examples of [[Drug Classes#Arylcyclohexylamines|Arylcyclohexylamines]] class
Phencyclidine, sold as Sernyl, caused schizophrenic psychosis, aggressive behavior, catatonia
[[PCP]], "angel dust" first documented synthetic drug of abuse.
	Disturbing behaviors, extreme violence, self mutilation, cannibalism, and suicide
[[PCP]], N-methyl-D-aspartate (NDMA) receptor antagonism, inhibits dopamine and serotonin uptake.
Induce schizophrenic symptoms
[[ketamine]], synthesized in 1962 by Calvin Stevens
	effective anesthetic and much safer than [[PCP]]
	horse tranquilizer
known for antidepressant properties (I agree)
	rapid onset intravenously, reduce suicidal ideation
[[PCP]], [[ketamine]], crosses blood brain barrier, NDMAM receptor antagonist, key mechanism
racemate, S-enantiomer is more potent NMDA receptor
