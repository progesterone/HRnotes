### Abstract
- stigma negatively effects treatments, health care, research, policies, and societies.
- "Language can be used to promote stigma or decrease it."
- substance use disorder, SUD
- stigmatized language can create barriers in essential areas
	- health care, employment, insurance policies, and laws
- normalize destigmatizing language
	- more accepting society
- "stigma" = mark of disgrace
	- person seen less than others
	- based on assumptions or misconceptions
- "substance use disorder"
- language evolves, realizing power words carry
	- evolving from the usage of demeaning words
		- ex: "retard" or "idiots"
	- language needs to evolve to change stigmas
- Person first language
	- SUD language = person SUD language
- terms:
	- abuse, abuser, crazy, addict, dirty or clean
	- description of tox screen
	- status of a person
	- war on drugs
	- drug "habit"
	- "just say no"
		- substance use stigma is perpetuated through language
- people have the same emotional valence with "abuse" "asphyxiation" and "HIV"
	- "the term 'abuse' is also right between the words homicide and rape."
- "Abuse" incorrectly describes SUD
- 2017, Michael P. Botticelli, director of National Drug Control Policy
	- issued "changing the language of addiction"
		- encouraged government to consider language used internally, externally
	- "words used when discussing substance use suggests that the person has a personal failing"
		- "person in recovery" = variety of definitions
			- usually discontinuing their use to a healthier level
- 28 studies, 2000-2011, found health care professionals held negative attitudes to SUD patients
	- had minimal, poor training, and education about working with SUD patients
	- in effect, makes patients feel less empowered and receive poorer healthcare treatment
	- health care professionals gatekeep treatment 
		- important that they get training and education about SUD
- "we do not say individuals with diabetes are addicted to insulin"
	- addiction stigma affects recovery utilizing medication and recovery
- ongoing research says addiction is chronic brain disorder
	- not fault of the individual
		- stigma lives, "trading on drug for another"
		- MAT = medication assisted treatment
- individuals suffer in multiple ways
	- incarceration, unemployment, no family or significant support, homelessness, difficult in every day tasks
	- John Hopkins Bloomberg School or Public Health study showed general public did not support employment, housing, or insurance that benefits people who are dependent on drugs.
- SAMHSA = substance abuse mental health services administration
	- 2017, 30.5 million americans reported illicit drug use within the month
	- 19.7 million had SUD in the year
	- 11.1 million, 12+ yr, misused prescript opioids
	- 900k heroin use
	- 2.1mil had opioid disorder
	- 42k americans died from opioid overdose
- Parity Legislation and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires insurance companies to cover SUD the same as similar medical conditions.
	- "Uncovering the Gaps II" - over half states did not comply with ACA

# What can we do to address stigma?
- reduce stigma through:
	- creating visible social identity of recovery
		- David Best Study: Jobs, Friends and Houses, provides employment opportunity for coming out of prison and people with SUD.
			- have attracted outside contracts due to quality and efficiency of work.
- "Stigma is still the largest challenge we face. It prevents people from coming into treatment. The moment was right (for me to speak out). If we're talking about ending stigma, people like myself have to speak up."
- other ways to address stigma:
	- educate the public & professionals about SUD and stigmas
	- writing papers, be care of the words you use.
		- put people first
	- speak against substance use stigma
	- listen without judgement
	- demand equality
	- petition government lawmakers for less criminal penalties for drug users and other laws that enable stigma

### "Every person must consciously make an effort to use destigmatized language when referring to substance use and individuals with substance use disorders."
