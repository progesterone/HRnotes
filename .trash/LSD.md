## Personal Reflections:
One of my favorite substances, it's a substance that I used for recreational fun early on, but eventually I started using it as a sort of experimental therapeutic substance, usually invoking ego death, which I haven't experience too many times; Which I do not recommend the way I used it, as it's unpredictable. LSD culturally for me was somewhat seen as a pretty uncommon substance socially when I first used it, but a pretty researched substance. 

My first experience wasn't particularly glamorous, I bought some, took a tab, played counter-strike, and chilled out to music as I peaked mid game. As I continued to peak I started to watch YouTube, where I found seeing people speaking to be disturbing, everyone felt disconnected and disjointed entirely, so I continued to lay back in my bed chatting with a friend who was tripping with me for the first time too. Truly a bonding experience...

fun fact: the first document consumption was on April 19th, 1943, which has been celebrated as 'Bicycle day' (according to Tripsit.me)
