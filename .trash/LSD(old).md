# Overview / Quick Notes
LSD is a classic psychedelic first invented around 1940s. LSD has very strong mental effects, medium visual effects, and mild-medium body effects. It's highly potent, being measured in ug, micrograms, with 10ug being a general threshold. Routes of administrations are always orally through blotter paper (small pieces of paper soaked in solution), pills, gelatin squares, liquid, and liquid sugar cubes. Tolerance builds quick, and is not known to be addictive and has a low toxicity. Common psychological negative reactions include increased paranoia, and anxiety. LSD is considered one of the safer substances to use, one of the well researched and studied substances as well.

##### Tolerance:
nearly doubles after an experience, usually tolerance will be halved after 3-4 days, and baseline, reset, after a week. Depends on dose.
#### Blotters:
Place piece under the tongue for 8-10 minutes, swallow or spit. Keeping it under the tongue longer has yet to be proven effective. **Blotters should only taste like paper,** if it's bitter, sweet, or anything BUT paper, **spit it out.** **==Always test your substances.==**

## Storage:
LSD is pretty sensitive, as it's sensitive to light, temperature, oxygen, and moisture. LSD, if stored within a book, at room temperature, can last months to a year. 
## Safety & Harm‑Reduction Checklist 
- **Test**: Use a reagent kit (e.g., Ehrlich’s, Marquis). 
- Paper should taste *only* of paper; any bitterness or sweetness -> discard. 
- **Set & Setting**: Quiet, comfortable space; soft lighting; preferably a trusted sitter (in‑person or virtual). 
- **Hydration**: Sip water periodically; avoid over‑hydration. 
- **Dosage**: Start at 50 µg for first‑time; never exceed 150 µg without prior experience. 
- **Medical Contra‑indications**: Avoid if you have a personal/family history of psychosis, uncontrolled hypertension, or are on serotonergic meds (SSRIs, MAOIs). 
- **Emergency Plan**: Keep a phone nearby, know the nearest medical facility, and have a sitter who knows how to call emergency services.
## Tips
* Setting: Best to lay on a bed or couch, with a light blanket.
* A trip sitter, in person or virtual, is advised for first-timers incase of overwhelming thoughts.
* Start small, as cliche as this tip is, LSD is seriously a strong substance.
* ALWAYS TEST. With that being said, when taking a blotter, there should be no taste other than paper.
## Personal Reflections:
One of my favorite substances, it's a substance that I used for recreational fun early on, but eventually I started using it as a sort of experimental therapeutic substance, usually invoking ego death, which I haven't experience too many times; Which I do not recommend the way I used it, as it's unpredictable. LSD culturally for me was somewhat seen as a pretty uncommon substance socially when I first used it, but a pretty researched substance. 

My first experience wasn't particularly glamorous, I bought some, took a tab, played counter-strike, and chilled out to music as I peaked mid game. As I continued to peak I started to watch YouTube, where I found seeing people speaking to be disturbing, everyone felt disconnected and disjointed entirely, so I continued to lay back in my bed chatting with a friend who was tripping with me for the first time too. Truly a bonding experience...

fun fact: the first document consumption was on April 19th, 1943, which has been celebrated as 'Bicycle day' (according to Tripsit.me.)

On a NeedleDrop rating scale, a strong 9 is fitting for this substance.

## Experiences:
I havent had any new experiences written since January 15th, 2026.
