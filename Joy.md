# Who am I?
Hello! I'm Joy, a 21 year old trans thing from Seattle, who's simply engaging in a old obsession: studying and learning about drugs and substances! My background in substances is pretty shallow as of writing, February 17th 2026, however I plan on changing that. I am no chemist, not a well adventured psychonaut, nor am I an experienced harm reductionist, however with time I hope that I become familiar with as much as I can within this topic.
# What is this? Why am I making this?
This is my personal obsidian web about substances, harm reduction, and other related research. Creating this was always a little bit of a side project to do. As time moves on, I find that Wikipedia style pages about substances are slowly being deprecated, getting all moldy, or feel incomplete, I begin to feel as if this project grows in importance. Though you shouldn't use this as a sole resource, I'll try my best to collect as much information and resources as I can to slim the chances of misinformation. As I build this, I hope that eventually this becomes something under my tool belt when engaging with harm reduction in real life and in the future. 

I got the original idea of this project when I saw several conflicting bits of information between forums and reddit posts when looking up effects of several substances. To combat the conflicting information, or at least assist with the fight for proper clarity, I wanted to centralize all the information I can find to one spot. Later I found out about [[Dominic Milton Trott|Dominic Trott's]] "The Drug User's Bible" and felt inspired to become invested into this project, as it's a wonderful resource!
# Expectations
As stated previously, I do not recommend you use this as a sole source for information. I'm not a professional. This is for my own personal use. I highly encourage everyone to ask medical professionals and other highly educated people about substances instead. I am however flattered if anyone sees that this project has value.
