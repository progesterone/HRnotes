# Joy's Harm Reduction Notes
Harm reduction is the practice of minimizing harm of substance use through policy, community outreach, and education. The importance of harm reduction spans from a individual to a community, from a state to a country. Harm reduction aims to save life's from reducing spread of bloodborne illnesses, preventing overdosing, putting people first, and the reduce of negative stigmas within language and the social landscape. The inception of harm reduction started from the increasingly implementation of litigation against drug users, those in recovery, and those who seek help-- People who are harmed by outdated and ill-informed laws and policies.

This repository was created to better archive my growing Obsidian note about substances. This resource is meant for personal use and reflection, not as a sole resource for research. I'm flattered if anyone sees any value of this project.

If I have any conflicting, misrepresenting, or misinterepting information, notes, or write ups, please contact me.
