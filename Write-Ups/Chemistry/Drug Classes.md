## Lysergamides or Ergoamides
Lysergamides or Ergoamides, are amides, which is a general base structure of a compound, in particular lysergic acids.
Ergoline is a class of substances/compounds that stem from ergot, a group of fungi.
This amide are believed to affect the 5-HT2A receptor, which induce psychedelic effects.
Substances under this class are:

| [[LSD]]         | [[ALD-52]] | [[1B-LSD]]  | [[1cP-LSD]] | [[1V-LSD]]    | [[ETH-LAD]] | [[1P-ETH-LAD]]            |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| [[LSA]]         | [[1P-LSD]] | [[PRO-LAD]] | [[AL-LAD]]  | [[PARGY-LAD]] | [[iso-LSD]] | [[LAE-32]]                |
| [[LAMPA]]       | [[LSH]]    | [[MiPLA]]   | [[EiPLA]]   | [[LSZ]]       | [[LSM-775]] | <br>[[Methylergometrine]] |
| [[Ergometrine]] |            |             |             |               |             |                           |

## Tryptamines
Tryptamine is a compounds based on the tryptamine molecule which consists of a indole ring and a ethylamine side chain. Tryptamine can occur naturally in a few plants, fungi, and even animals. Some major neurotransmitters are tryptamine derivatives, such as serotonin, melatonin, and [[DMT]].
Substances that are structurally derived, or added/substituted from tryptamine:

| [[Psilocin]] | [[Psilocybin]] | N,N-Dimethyltryptamine ([[DMT]]) | [[5-MeO-DMT]] | [[4-AcO-DMT]] | [[4-HO-MET]] | [[DET]] |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| [[DIPT]]     |                |                                  |               |               |              |         |
## Phenethylamines
A Phenethylamine drug is any compound that has a phenethylamine backbone structure, a benzene ring attached to an ethylamine chain. Neurotransmitters that are related are Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Epinephrine (Adrenaline.) This is a huge class of psychoactive drugs, such as stimulants, entactogens/empathogens, and some classical psychedelics.

Related substances:
[[MDMA]]
[[Mescaline]]
2C-x
	[[2C-B]]
[[DOx]]
[[Amphetamine]]
Methamphetamine

## Arylcyclohexylamines

## Classical Psychedelics
Classical Psychedelic, or also called serotonergic psychedelic, is classified by it's primary mechanism on the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor. Substances that are a 5-HT2A agonists or a partial agonist are make the classification. Classical Psychedelics cause cross-tolerance with each other, alter perception, cognition and sense of self. This is a family tree with the 3 previously mentioned classes, [[Drug Classes#Phenethylamines|Phenethylamines]], [[Drug Classes#Lysergamides or Ergoamides|Lysergamides]], and [[Drug Classes#Tryptamines|Tryptamines]].

Often times these substances share similar therapeutic mechanisms, have the ability for ego loss, and produce similar brain network changes.

# Definitions
**Amides** are organic compounds from carboxylic acids, widely found in many systems such as proteins, plastics pharmaceuticals and more.
**Indole** is a compound of six joint benzene rings fused with a five pyrrole ring, a building block of neurotransmitters.
**Ethylamine** an organic compound used in chemical industry including pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.
**Norepinephrine** basically adrenaline, responsible for "fight or flight" responses, increases heart-rate, alertness and blood pressure.
**Epinephrine** this is adrenaline but with broader effects like heart rate and energy availability.

>Agonists - molecules on binding cause receptor activation
Full Agonists - same level receptor activation by high concertation
Partial Agonists - partial GPCR activation
Antagonists - block agonists by binding to remote parts, stopping GPCR manipulation
Inverse Agonists - stabilize inactive receptors, reducing baseline activity
