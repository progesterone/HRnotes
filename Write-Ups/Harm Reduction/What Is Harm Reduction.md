### So what is it? What does it do?
Harm reduction is the practice of minimizing harm of substance use through policy, community outreach, and education. The importance of harm reduction spans from a individual to a community, from a state to a country. Harm reduction aims to save life's from reducing spread of bloodborne illnesses, preventing overdosing, putting people first, and the reduce of negative stigmas within language and the social landscape. The inception of harm reduction started from the increasingly implementation of litigation against drug users, those in recovery, and those who seek help-- People who are harmed by outdated and ill-informed laws and policies.

Drug use has been around as long as humans have been eating berries off of bushes. The earliest evidence of drug use dates back to prehistoric times, with ancient civilizations utilizing plants like opium, [[Cannabis]], [[Mescaline]] and other psychoactive substances for different reasons, such as religious, spiritual, and medicinal needs.

# Principles of Harm Reduction
1. Stigmas and social aspects
2. The law
3. Health and reducing risks
4. Community and resources

"Stigmas and social aspects" - Combatting the idea that drug use is a moral failure and the harsh treatment of users, those in recovery, and those seeking help.
"The law" - The push for reform of outdated, ill-informed, bigoted laws set in place
"Health and reducing risks" - Recognizing what puts you at risk, and what you and other's can do to limit those risks.
"Community and resources" - Centers, awareness, programs, and education. The resources pushing for policy changes, keeping communities safe, and other out reach initiatives.


# Stigmas and Social Aspects
#### [[Stigma, how it affects the substance use disorder patient]]: 
> the word “abuse” has the same emotional valence as the words “asphyxiation” and “HIV.” The term “abuse” is also right between the words homicide and rape

Language matters when talking about drug users. Stigmas are often perpetuated through language, such as "abuse." When talking about people who use, the language changes from "people's language" to "people who use substances language." Often times this language dehumanizes, or belittles the person that we talk about; Creating a "them versus us" communication structure. This can lead to poorly trained health professionals to gatekeep essential treatments for people with SUD, substance use disorder, or have insurance companies not comply with ACA, Affordable Care Act. Language can devalue people.
