Harm reduction is the practice of safer substance use, and preventative of bloodborne illnesses, usually through policy change, programs and practices. In return, harm reduction aims to ["minimize the negative health, social and legal impacts associated with drug use, drug policies and drug laws."](https://hri.global/what-is-harm-reduction/) Harm reduction used to also include safe sex as a corner stone, however groups and activists have been shifting their focus to be more about drugs and substances.

Drug use has been around as long as humans have been eating berries off of bushes. The earliest evidence of drug use dates back to prehistoric times, with ancient civilizations utilizing plants like opium, cannabis, mescaline and other psychoactive substances for different reasons, such as religious, spiritual, and medicinal needs.

# Principles of Harm Reduction
1. Stigmas and social aspects
2. The law
3. Health and reducing risks
4. Community and resources

"Stigmas and social aspects" - Combatting the idea that drug use is a moral failure and the harsh treatment of users, those in recovery, and those seeking help.
"The law" - The push for reform of outdated, ill-informed, bigoted laws set in place
"Health and reducing risks" - Recognizing what puts you at risk, and what you and other's can do to limit those risks.
"Community and resources" - Centers, awareness, programs, and education. The resources pushing for policy changes, keeping communities safe, and other out reach initiatives.


# Stigmas and Social Aspects
#### [[Stigma, how it affects the substance use disorder patient]]: 
> the word “abuse” has the same emotional valence as the words “asphyxiation” and “HIV.” The term “abuse” is also right between the words homicide and rape

Language matters when talking about drug users. Stigmas are often perpetuated through language, such as "abuse." When talking about people who use, the language changes from "people's language" to "people who use substances language." Often times this language dehumanizes, or belittles the person that we talk about; Creating a "them versus us" communication structure. This can lead to poorly trained health professionals to gatekeep essential treatments for people with SUD, substance use disorder, or have insurance companies not comply with ACA, Affordable Care Act. Language can devalue people.
