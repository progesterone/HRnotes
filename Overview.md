This is an overview, a sort of table of contents of this obsidian web. Each 4 sections, that being **Write-ups**, **Joy's Drug Bible**, **Research**, and **Experience Logs**, will contain obsidian links to each entry of it's respected area.

A good starting point to learn what this note about would be "[[What Is Harm Reduction]]." This will have a general understanding of what Harm reduction is, and it's goals. Another page to start with would be about me "[[Joy]]," as this will explain bit of who I am, what this page intends to be, and possible show you what biases and unrealized prejudices I have. 

Though stated in several locations already, please do not use this as a sole resource. I'm human, I will make mistakes. I'm not a professional, I'm a 21 year old who barely passed high school. My experience nor knowledge is not as vast as other. This project is intended to be a collection of my own personal notes to equip myself for harm reduction work in the future, amping my toolset. I will be flattered, and in full blush, if anyone sees any value in this.
